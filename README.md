# ToggleCase

\!\[feature X\]\(images/singlereplace.gif\)

Toggle case of the selected string:

- <kbd>Ctrl+;</kbd> Linux
- <kbd>âŒ˜+;</kbd> MacOS

in the following order:

1. nocase -> camelCase
2. camelCase -> CapitalizedCamelCase
3. CapitalizedCamelCase -> snake_case
4. snake_case -> kebab-case
5. kebab-case -> camelCase

If you wish to overwrite the default shortcut, search for `editor.togglecase`.

## Features

- Works with multi-select and multiple carets
- Per `languageId` customization

## Extension Settings

Only setting present (and configurable for different languages) is regexp of
characters that can occur as **second and second last** in the variable name.

* `togglecase.pattern`: `"[0-9]|[a-z]|[A-Z]|_|-"`

with the following defaults:

* lowercase `a-z` letters
* uppercase `A-Z` letters
* digits `0-9`
* hyphen `-`
* underscore `_`

Letters come from the english alphabet.

Custom per-language configuration - let's assume that you're crazy enough to
use `$` inside your variable names, for example `btc_$_price` (please don't).

In that case, you could extend the default RegExp with an additional `|\$`:

```json
"configurationDefaults": {
  "[javascript]": {
    "togglecase.pattern": "[0-9]|[a-z]|[A-Z]|_|-|\$"
  }
```

It might be useful for some other languages, hence it's configurable.

## Known Issues

Toggle works only when caret is **at least on the third-last character of the targeted variable**.

In the examples below, the `|` represents current carret(s).

### Does not work

```
{
  "first_nam|e": "Jon",
  "last_nam|e": "Doe",
  "user_nam|e": "jondoe",
  "phone_numbe|r": "555666777"
}
```

### Does work

```
{
  "first_na|me": "Jon",
  "last_na|me": "Doe",
  "user_na|me": "jondoe",
  "phone_numb|er": "555666777"
}
```

Fix for this behavior is welcome.
